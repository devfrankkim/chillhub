@import "page.css"; 
problem is 
컴포넌트와 CSS가 분리되어 있다.
하나는 JS파일로, 하나는 CSS 파일로.
컴포넌트를 이용하는 것의 요점은 어플리케이션의 부분 부분을 캡슐화하는 것이다.


1. CSS module. 
create-react-app에서 사용가능하다.
javaScript 객체로 사용할 수 있다.
Header.module.scss or 
Header.module.css (local로 바꿔준다.)
import styles from "./Header.module.css";
navList 
className ={styles.navList}
javaScript에서는 nav-list 처럼 -를 사용할 수 없다.
className 기억하는데 고통스럽다.


2. yarn add styled-components







This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
